      EventNetUSA built a private island retreat in the Hudson River, equipped
      with a climate controlled hut, beach volleyball court and plenty of
      amenaties for the Hache Family to enjoy during their 7 day tropical
      vacation. The island was open to the public and guests were invited to
      visit the island using a rented tugboat which made trips from the mainland
      every 30 minutes









      ### A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES









      * Barges, temporarily anchored off lower-Manhatten, were used as the 5,400
      squarefoot island’s foundation

      * 4 Tons of sand and landscaping elements were installed on the island for
      an authentic tropical setting

      * A generator was used to supply electricity for the hut and water tanks
      enabled fully functioning plumbing

      * Total island production time was 10 working days

      * Broadcast on CBS News, NBC News, ABC News and Entertainment Tonight
