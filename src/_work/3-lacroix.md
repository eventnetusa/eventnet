A true guerilla marketing success story, LaCroix’s cult following can be largely attributed to their decision to market experientially over traditional methods like print or TV advertising.

EventNetUSA has helped execute their efforts through turnkey, in-field programs that continue to evolve with the brand, the latest being the Fall 2016 multi-market Sampling Program.
