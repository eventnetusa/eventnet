      In 2006, the health insurance industry took a major turn with the launch of
      Medicare Part D. Looking for a way to spearhead the industry's sudden need
      for consumer outreach and education, Humana turned to EventNetUSA.&nbsp;



      EventNetUSA conceptualized, designed and executed the "Let's Talk"
      campaign, a nationwide mobile education tour designed to help Medicare
      beneficiaries learn about new plan and prescription drug coverage options.



      To tackle the challenge of reaching America's 42 million Medicare
      beneficiaries, EventNetUSA built a fleet of eight RVs and recruited
      Medicare Advisors who would travel the country, visiting with seniors at
      senior centers, medical centers, senior expos, Walmart Supercenters and
      Sam's Club stores.



      At each stop, consumers learned about important dates related to the
      enrollment process and how to research prescription drug availability.
      Humana Medicare Advisors also offered guidance as to which type of plan may
      be best suited for a beneficiary based on health, lifestyle and income
      criteria.



      Year 1 of the Let's Talk RV tour was so successful, reaching more than
      250,000 consumers between August 2005 and May 2006 and travelling over
      110,000 miles, Humana decided to renew the program with EventNetUSA for
      years 2 and 3.



      Taking key learnings from year 1, EventNetUSA enhanced the Let's Talk
      program to include learning sessions and activities offered through the
      Humana Active Outlook lifestyle enrichment program, including better bone
      health, nutrition and brain fitness.
