      In 2005 the health insurance industry underwent major changes with the
      launch of Medicare Part D. To spearhead the industry's sudden need for
      consumer outreach and education, Humana turned to EventNetUSA.&nbsp;



      Leveraging Humana's partnership with Walmart, we conceptualized, designed
      and executed the national "Let's Talk" Campaign. The tour was designed to
      educate Walmart's Senior shoppers and to help beneficiaries learn about new
      plan and prescription drug coverage options.



      We built a fleet of ten RVs and recruited and trained 20 Medicare Advisors
      who would travel the country, visiting with seniors at senior centers,
      medical centers, senior expos in addition to Walmart Supercenters and Sam's
      Club stores.



      Onsite, Humana Medicare Advisors offered RV guests guidance as to which
      type of plan may be best suited based on their health, lifestyle and income
      criteria.



      Year 1 of the Let's Talk RV tour was so successful, reaching more than
      250,000 consumers between August 2005 and May 2006 and travelling over
      110,000 miles, Humana renewed the program with EventNetUSA for years 2 and
      3.



      Taking key learnings from year 1, EventNetUSA enhanced the Let's Talk
      program to include learning sessions and activities offered through the
      Humana Active Outlook lifestyle enrichment program, including better bone
      health, nutrition and brain fitness.
