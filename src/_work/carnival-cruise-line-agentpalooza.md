      Carnival Cruise Line retained EventNetUSA to produce and operate its
      award-winning Agentpalooza Campaign Tours, visiting travel agents around
      the country.


      Hosted by Carnival’s Executive Sales Team, Agentpalooza celebrated travel
      agents and the *rock stars* they are through exclusive, invite-only
      events.


      AgentPalooza cranked up the volume to create a true rock star experience.
      Travel agents arrived via limo entrance with paparazzi and fans crowding
      the red carpet, begging for autographs and photos. Stylists and makeup
      teams brought out the inner-rocker in every agent for concert stage
      photos. VIP swag bags and must-have giveaways topped every event, sending
      agents home ready to rock for Carnival.&nbsp;
