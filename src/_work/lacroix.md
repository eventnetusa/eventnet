For over 11 years, LaCroix Sparkling Water has entrusted EventNetUSA to place product in the hands of consumers using street team sampling, tradeshow exhibiting, and mobile marketing programs.

A true guerilla marketing success story, LaCroix’s cult following can be largely attributed to their decision to market experientially over traditionally (they have never run a traditional print or TV advertisement).

EventNetUSA has helped execute their efforts through turnkey, in-field programs that continue to evolve with the brand.

A LOOK AT THE FALL 2016 SAMPLING PROGRAM

* Executed 2 week sampling program taking place simultaneously in Austin, Chicago, Ft. Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco
* Contracted and trained 6 teams of brand ambassadors, including tour managers in selected markets
* Developed strategic routing calendar targeting “mom’s and families” demographic to maximize sampling program effectiveness
