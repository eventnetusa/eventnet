      OverUnderMillionaire is an e-commerce sales acquisition startup, leveling
      the playing field for retailers across the U.S. that are looking for a
      better way to market their business through gamification.


      42-year brand marketing veteran Joel Benson was fascinated by this concept
      but noticed many e-commerce and gamification partnerships were one-sided
      or potentially deemed as untrustworthy by the consumer. Instead, he
      launched a platform that was mutually beneficial for all parties.


      *Here’s how it works:*


      * *Consumers download the free app (no credit card needed, ever) and
      register to play.*

      * *In a series of sports betting games, users have a one in four chance to
      win a prize from the “Winner’s Corner.” Think HQ Trivia, but instead of
      taking your chance for a money prize, OverUnderMillionaire offers a
      rotating selection of gift cards or retail prizes (these change
      periodically based on current sponsors).*

      * *The “Winner’s Corner” consists of prizes donated by sponsors (gift
      cards for a preselected amount, unsold retail items, overstock, etc.).The
      sponsors do NOT pay OverUnderMillionaire until a user has visited their
      website and purchased their product.*

      * *The player chooses among the sponsored items, redeems their prize, and
      then can play all over again. Bonus: the more the user plays, the higher
      chance of winning and going back to the “Winner’s Corner”\!*


      *OverUnderMillionaire celebrates the popularity of sports and the growth
      of the e-commerce segment, creating a gratifying game with free gift cards
      to top retailers that entices consumers to continue playing and converting
      these players into loyal customers for e-commerce companies.*
