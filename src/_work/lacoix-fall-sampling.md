      A true guerilla marketing success story, LaCroix’s cult following can be
      largely attributed to their decision to market experientially over
      traditional methods like print or TV advertising.

      EventNetUSA has supported their efforts through turnkey, in-field programs
      that continue to evolve with the brand, the latest being the Fall 2016
      multi-market Sampling Program.
