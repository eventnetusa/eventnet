The White House, through the Partnership for a Healthier America and Young & Rubican, approached EventNetUSA to design and produce First Lady Michelle Obama's national Drink Up America Water Campaign launch.

The water themed carnival, held in the Watertown High School gymnasium, featured Dunk the Principal, water relay races, water ring toss and Ride the Surf. Actress Eva Longoria and a dozen other water groups also attended the Watertown, WI event.
