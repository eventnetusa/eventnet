Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) is one of the largest licensees of BlueCross BlueShield, operating in 5 states.

When Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched in 2013, HCSC teamed with EventNetUSA to expand its brand reach, increase key retail partner relationships and find and enroll eligible consumers into the government’s new ACA Plans.

To ensure reach and depth of knowledge about HCSC’s ACA offerings, EventNetUSA executed a three pronged approach using Mobile Assistance Centers (MAC), Pop-Up Retail Stores and a Mobile Enrollment RV in the Texas, Illinois and Oklahoma markets.

Each channel played an integral role in educating consumers on the Healthcare Reform and how ACA works, engaging through relevant content and enrolling new members on-site.
