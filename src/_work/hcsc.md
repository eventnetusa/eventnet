      When Affordable Care Act (ACA) launched in 2013, HCSC teamed with
      EventNetUSA to expand its brand reach, increase key retail partner
      relationships and find and enroll eligible consumers into the government’s
      new ACA Plans.


      To ensure reach and depth of knowledge about HCSC’s ACA offerings,
      EventNetUSA executed a three pronged approach using Mobile Assistance
      Centers (MAC), Pop-Up Retail Stores and a Mobile Enrollment RV. Each
      channel played an integral role in educating consumers on the Healthcare
      Reform and how ACA works, engaging through relevant content and enrolling
      new members on-site.
