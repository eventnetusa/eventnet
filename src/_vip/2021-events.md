  eye-catching and memorable consumer engagement using your existing display
  materials, rebranding ours or building something new

  3. <u><strong>Leave the rest to us</strong></u> – event contracting, display
  transportation, staffing, setup/teardown, Covid-protocol, reporting… \*the
  whole kit and caboodle \*
