      EventNetUSA's Medicare Mall Pop-Up Events originated as a solution to
      support a provider's under performing retail stores. Since the first event
      in April 2017, the innovative program has made its way into seven US
      markets, spanning coast-to-“beyond coast” (Hawaii\!).


      The program continues to expand and evolve into a truly personalized
      solution for supporting Seniors and their unique interests and needs.
      Pop-up events create a weekly event experience, offering free activities
      and classes to members and non-members.&nbsp;


      More than free activities, Pop-Up GC’s create a safe space to socialize
      with peers and support a healthier physical and mental well-being.


      Let's discuss your unique Medicare goals to design a program that fits
      your needs and budget.&nbsp;
