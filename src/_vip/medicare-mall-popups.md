      From original idea as a solution to support under-performing
      &nbsp;brick-and-mortar stores, Mall Center Court Pop-Ups are fast becoming
      the new home for AEP and year ‘round community outreach for insurance
      providers.&nbsp;


      Custom branded displays set in high-traffic mall courts by EventNetUSA
      create a safe space for Medicare eligible adults to socialize with
      provider Agents and peers in support of a healthier physical and mental
      well-being.


      Free activities and classes open to members and non-members at 9 a.m.
      attracting early mall walkers, ending mid-afternoon. Providers have the
      option to open for one specified day per week and can run weekly,
      bi/weekly or even weekends\!


      Let’s discuss your unique Medicare goals to design a program that fits
      your needs and budget.
