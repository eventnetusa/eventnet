      **POP-UP GUIDANCE CENTERS**


      Humana’s Pop-Up Guidance Center events take place in shopping malls, where
      Seniors come to participate in free health education seminars, fitness
      classes, one-on-one consultations and biometric screenings.


      Now operating in its second year, program objectives include:


      * Reinforce “Humana is here for you” message to improve member
      satisfaction and retention

      * Increase awareness of Humana Medicare resources like Go365 and
      SilverSneakers Fitness Classes

      * Close gaps of care for eligible Humana Medicare members by providing
      biometric health screenings and take-home test kits

      * Generate new Medicare enrollment leads and increase brand awareness


      A LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES


      * Event Set-Up and Operations:

      * Events operate weekly and bi-weekly in select shopping malls year-round

      * Daily set-up/tear-down of branded modular displays, furniture and
      fixtures

      * HIPAA compliant private consultation and screening rooms

      * Promotional and directional signage throughout venues

      * Field teams include Event Manager and Brand Ambassadors
