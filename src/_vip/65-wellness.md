      EventNetUSA, founded in 1976, works for leading consumer brands in
      fashion, sports, health, finance and food industries. We create events
      that introduce brand products to consumers through one-on-one experiential
      marketing. To date, we have produced over 5 million consumer
      activations.&nbsp;


      Our client, a leading health insurance provider, is looking to reach
      Medicare eligible seniors to engage and educate on health, wellness and
      how to best utilize Medicare services.&nbsp;


      We seek opportunities to lease space at facilities like yours to bring our
      Medicare Information Trailer (shown below) for 1-3 day events.&nbsp;


      Free to attendees, events will include demonstrations, health screenings,
      healthy refreshments and information on where to go for future Medicare
      services.&nbsp;
