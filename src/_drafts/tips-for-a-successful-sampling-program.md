      <p>Summer is here and that means Street-Team Sampling Season is too!
      Here are 5 tips for creating and executing a successful brand-in-hand
      campaign.</p><p>&nbsp;Define Your Demographic</p><p>An audience can be
      defined any number of ways based on an almost infinite number of criteria.
      But your audience is unique to your brand, so you&rsquo;re going to want to
      identify the factors that can be used to create a better connection between
      their interests and what your company offers.</p><p>Basic Demographic
      Points to Consider</p>

      <ul><li>Age</li><li>Gender</li><li>Ethnicity</li><li>Lifestyle</li><li>SexuaOrientation</li><li>Household Status</li><li>Geography</li><li>Interests/Hobbies</li><li>Beliefs/Opinions</li><li>Profession</li><li>Income Level</li><li>Residence Type</li></ul><p>2. Routing Around Town</p><p>Now  that you&rsquo;ve defined your target demographic, identify relevant
      opportunities for reaching consumers and create a customized routing
      strategy for the overall program.</p><p>For example, taking the target
      demographic: Mom&rsquo;s with Young Children</p><p>Relevant Sampling
      Locations May Include</p>

      <ul><li>Parks and Playgrounds</li><li>Little League Sports
      Fields</li><li>Mommy&amp;Me Classes</li><li>School Carpool
      Lanes</li><li>Special Events (i.e. Disney on Ice)</li><li>Family Parades
      and Festivals</li><li>Famer&rsquo;s Markets</li><li>Parking lots of product
      retailers</li></ul>

      Be sure to consider other important factors too like peak times, ease or
      difficulty of sampling in the location and always have a backup plan for
      weather, law enforcement or other factors that might throw a wrench into
      your plans.

      <p>3. Staffing for Success</p><p>Your sampling team is the face and
      voice of your brand on the streets, so hiring the right staff is vital to
      the success of any sampling program. At a minimum, Brand Ambassadors should
      have the following qualifications:</p><ul><li>Plenty of previous sampling
      experience across different brands, products and services</li><li>Reflect
      the look of your target demographic</li><li>Ability to &nbsp;expertly
      deliver key brand messaging*</li><li>Comprehensive knowledge of the
      sampling markets</li></ul><p>*Keep in mind, a good team is only as good as
      the brand training they receive. Providing your agency with proper tools
      and materials for training sampling staff if a must!</p><p>4. What&rsquo;s
      the Take-Away?</p><p>Brand Ambassadors typically have a narrow window for
      communicating a brand&rsquo;s key message to consumers. Maximize that time
      with an effective message that leaves a lasting impression.</p><p>To
      facilitate a connection between your brand and the consumer, keep your
      message quick, relatable and easy to understand.</p><p>If your product or
      service is complex or has a list of benefits, create a simple sampling
      message that shares the most important features consumers should retain and
      share.</p><p>For example, rather than listing a myriad of natural
      ingredients in a new face moisturizer, focus on overall benefits the
      consumer wants to receive: All natural ingredients improve moisture and
      elasticity for brighter, more youthful looking skin.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy
      for the brand ambassador to deliver and easy for the consumer to
      comprehend.</p><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve gained the consumers interest and
      motivation to try your product sample, share the nitty gritty details on
      packaging or inserts to be read later when the consumer is invested in
      learning more.</p><p>5. Reporting</p><p>Before feet hit the street, define
      what metrics and data you want to take away from the overall
      program.</p><p>Sample Reporting Metrics</p>
