      Are you looking to join the rapidly increasing number of brands taking
      their marketing efforts to the streets? Are you holding back because you
      think you can do it in-house for cheaper? Whether you need to convince
      yourself, your team, or your boss, these 8 reasons will show you why you
      need to hire an experiential marketing agency for your next brand
      activation.





      1. **Retain Complete Control**





      You define the agency’s role. An experiential marketing agency’s objective
      is to support you where you most need it. You have bigger things to focus
      on than tracking shipments or staff t-shirt sizes. An agency filters
      through the logistics so you can make real decisions.





      1. **Score the Cream of the Crop**





      Agencies have the experience and connections to land you the best marketing
      vehicles, displays, and brand ambassadors across the U.S. Great
      experiential marketing agencies will have an extensive inventory and
      network of supplies, vendors and talent that are well-seasoned in the
      industry. They likely have relationships in place that will help score the
      best price there is, saving you the hours it takes to figure out what the
      market value for your need even is.





      1. **A Tried & True Process**





      Any master of their craft tests their methods and adjusts to optimize
      success. The more years in the industry, the more opportunity there is to
      boil down a tried & true turnkey event production and management process.
      You don’t have years to master event logistics, so hire a seasoned
      veteran!





      1. **Permits, Parking, Police**





      3 things no event planner loves to deal with; 3 things an agency will
      endure just for you.





      1. **Reporting to Your Boss**





      They want to know how many people showed up, how many samples were given
      out, how many posts to social media used your #hashtag, and all the other
      analytics needed to measure your return on investment (ROI). Tell an agency
      your key performance indicators and they’ll report the numbers!





      1. **It’s the Little Things**





      When you go to an agency that specializes in event logistics, you’re hiring
      experts of the event production industry: They know every ingredient, down
      to the fire extinguisher! Flowers, batteries extension cords, and dinner
      reservations for your team after the big launch are the small touches that
      make a difference.





      1. **Insurance**





      Ice cream can melt, tents can fly away, tires can go flat. A $10 million
      liability insurance plan keeps you covered when life happens.





      1. **On Time & On Budget**





      You’ll save both time and money when you outsource your brand activations.
      When your contract is signed, you have a team committed to keeping one eye
      on the calendar and the other on the bottom line. You’ll be notified of
      approaching deadlines and purchases will be made with your budget in mind.





      &nbsp;





      In the end, you’re hiring experts to do expert work. As long as you hire an
      experiential marketing agency with a reputable list of clients, a diverse
      portfolio, and numbers that show results, you’ll be happy you saved the
      drama and put your time and money in the hands of industry professionals.
