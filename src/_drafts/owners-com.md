      As seen on [Boston
      Magazine](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/property/blog/2016/06/30/owners-house-city-hall-plaza/)


      In the middle of the empty, brick expanse that is City Hall Plaza, sits a
      small white house.


      The “house” has a white picket fence, a few planters, and a lemonade
      stand—but the structure is actually a 53-foot-long trailer. It’s been
      traveling around the country, introducing a recently acquired brokerage
      called Owners.com to different markets. The website launched in its fifth
      city—Boston—this week.


      From Thursday, June 30 through Saturday, July 2, the lone house/trailer
      will try to make Bostonians in City Hall Plaza feel at home with
      Owners.com. The company is part brokerage and part listing inventory, and
      attempts to guide users through the home buying or selling process without
      putting agents in control. Instead, users work with agents via email or
      phone to help in scheduling showings and submitting offers.


      Nicole Messier, a consumer real estate expert with the website, explains
      that Owners.com takes the traditional real estate process, “infuses it
      with technology,” and helps to deliver consumer savings back to the
      homebuyer. This is done in part with a 1.5 percent buyer’s rebate, which
      gives a buyer purchasing a $500,000 home, for example, $7,500 in savings.


      Messier adds the company differs from other web-based database/brokerage
      combinations (like Redfin or Compass) because of its efficiency. The
      easy-to-use interface could be especially helpful in Boston’s unique
      market, where one of the biggest hurdles in home buying can be submitting
      an offer (which often happens during hectic open houses).


      “The fact that you can click a button, write in an offer, agree to
      purchase, and submit that to the seller’s agent within a matter of minutes
      is smart from a competitive standpoint,” says Messier. “It’s helping you
      fight through that competitive nature of the market.”


      And with housing costs reaching through the roof, plopping a house in the
      middle of the city is definitely one way to get a buyer’s attention.
