      ## **The experiential marketing industry’s first and only comprehensive
      guide to the best agency partners in the business**


      &nbsp;


      Our annual It List turns 17 this year, and like all 17-year-olds—it’s
      going through some changes. The It List is designed to reflect the
      changing needs of the brands and marketers who use it. So this year, we
      gave our It List application a facelift—tweaking our questions and
      selection criteria to better illuminate the agencies that are keeping pace
      with the industry—and what you need to be successful.


      Among updates, we put less emphasis on office culture and years in
      business and more emphasis on strategic thinking, creative culture and
      work. We wanted to understand better how the most innovative companies in
      events think. We also put more emphasis on new work as well as metrics,
      giving those companies delivering exceptional results for clients higher
      marks on our checklist. And we weighed the overall growth of the
      organizations: their top headlines of their year, awards won, client wins
      and new hires.


      This year’s list is comprised of start-ups and boutiques, legacy shops and
      monolithic organizations. Some have a few dozen employees, and some,
      hundreds worldwide. Some specialize in b-to-b, while others, in b-to-c.
      Some, in a little of both.


      As we have remarked over the past 17 years, the It List selection task is
      no walk in the park. Every year we huddle together for several weeks,
      scrutinizing newbies and veterans alike, digging through portfolios of
      work, and tracking the standout programs that captured the industry’s
      attention—all to provide the brand community the list of who it should be
      working with this year, and why. So, enjoy our annual guide and let the
      partner searching begin.
