      **From Event Marketer [It List
      Overview](http://www.eventmarketer.com/article/the-2017-it-list-recognizing-the-top-100-event-agencies/):**&nbsp;"Every
      year, we offer the industry’s most comprehensive listings to help event
      professionals know who to hire and where to work. The It List is our
      editor’s picks for the Top 100 Agencies in the industry. For brand
      marketers, this annual list is an invaluable resource that helps newbies
      and seasoned pros alike get a sense of who they can trust with their
      business based on any number of criteria.


      With hundreds of applications, it was no easy task to select the agencies
      featured in this year’s 15th annual It List.


      As we pored over the applications, we were struck by a number of facts.
      First, our industry is growing, as evidenced by the increases in head
      count, office spaces and new business wins mentioned in so many
      applications. Then, there is the inordinate amount of time and resources
      devoted to staying on top of trends as agencies invest in new technologies
      and equipment, especially digital interactives. And of course, there are
      the people themselves, those tireless engines who know no bounds when it
      comes to creativity, strategy and know-how in order to deliver top-notch
      experiences for some of the most demanding clients ever. The work this
      year was outstanding.


      It’s why our editorial team read, analyzed and scored each and every entry
      on a number of stringent criteria. Our top consideration: the percentage
      of agency work devoted exclusively to events. In an era of explosive
      growth, we recognized that there are a lot of shops out there with a
      sudden “expertise” in experiential, and so we were dead serious about
      checking their bonafides.


      Then, we looked at the quality of the work, the creativity, the agency’s
      industry reputation and, of course, how well each agency had backed up its
      claims. It was as exciting to read updates on the veterans as it was to
      comb through the capabilities of the new kids on the block. And we weighed
      each in equal measure.


      The one thing all of the agencies that made our list have in common? They
      are never satisfied with the status quo. They push toward goals they never
      thought achievable, burning the midnight oil to get every detail right.
      They’re the ones brands rely on to deliver unforgettable b-to-c and b-to-b
      experiences that forge lasting connections with consumers, colleagues and
      stakeholders. They’ve earned their place on our 15th annual It List and we
      take our hats off to each and every one of them."&nbsp;


      **From the EventNetUSA It List Summary:** "One of the oldest experiential
      marketing agencies in the industry (41 years), it’s known for producing
      the “impossible.” Think: Constructing an island on the Hudson River, and
      producing a live media event for the First Lady with three-weeks lead
      time. Among a diverse range of clients, added this year Carnival Cruise
      Line to expand its reach in travel and hospitality. A Beauty + Swag truck
      for NYX makeup, with express lip touch-ups and social media staging,
      generated 8,579 one-on-one interactions."
