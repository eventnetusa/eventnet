      **2010 – 2019 showed** a huge change in brands moving from traditional
      marketing to creating one-on-one experiences with their customers through
      experiential marketing. It has been a pleasure working with our brands and
      agencies to create these unique experiences and are grateful for our
      amazing clients.

      We kicked the decade off with LaCroix Sparkling Water, executing guerrilla
      sampling at one of the year’s largest events. By infiltrating South
      Florida with street teams, branded Vespas and Mini Coopers, LaCroix stole
      the show as the unofficial sponsor of Superbowl XLIV.

      ## **2014\| Bigelow: Mobile Tea Bar**


      We’ve been warming hearts across America with Bigelow for 5 years now.
      Bigelow came to with a need to promote and sample Bigelow tea at events
      and retailers, so we designed and transformed a 1977 Airstream into a
      Mobile Tea Bar complete with tasting bar, brewers, compliant food service
      areas, and historical lounge. Our favorite part? The social media photo
      activation with “Biggie” the Mascot\!
