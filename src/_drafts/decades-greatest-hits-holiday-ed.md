      Mobile Tea Bar complete with tasting bar, brewers, compliant food service
      areas, and historical lounge. Our favorite part? The social media photo

      ## **2018 \| Carnival Cruise Line: Agentpalooza Tour**


      For 2 years we have helped Carnival Cruise Line celebrated travel agents
      and the rock stars they are through exclusive, invite-only events.
      AgentPalooza cranked up the volume to create a true rock star experience.
      Travel agents arrived via limo entrance with paparazzi and fans crowding
      the red carpet, begging for autographs and photos. Stylists and makeup
      teams brought out the inner rocker in every agent for concert stage
      photos. Lido deck inspired games and activities were hosted by a Carnival
      Cruise Director. VIP swag bags and must-have giveaways topped every event,
      sending agents home ready to rock for Carnival.


      The VP of Sales & Trade Marketing even got a real “Travel Agents Rock”
      tattoo on stage to show his love for Carnival travel agents\!
