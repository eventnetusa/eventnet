      In 2013 The White House, through the Partnership for a Healthier America
      and Young & Rubican, approached EventNetUSA to design and produce First
      Lady Michelle Obama’s national Drink Up Campaign launch. The water themed
      carnival, held in the Watertown High School gymnasium, featured Dunk the
      Principal, water relay races, water ring toss and Ride the Surf. Actress
      Eva Longoria, local distributors Wis-Park Inc., 7UP Bottling, and a dozen
      other water groups also attended the Watertown, WI event.
