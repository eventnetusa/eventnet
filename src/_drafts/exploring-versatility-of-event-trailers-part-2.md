      At EventNetUSA, we supply mobile marketing trailers to a variety of
      clients in a number of diverse industries. Whether you’re looking for
      a&nbsp;[53’ trailer transformed into a pop-up
      shop](https://www.eventnetusa.com/work/revlon-love-is-on-tour/)&nbsp;or
      an&nbsp;[iconic Airstream turned Mobile Tea
      Bar](https://www.eventnetusa.com/work/bigelow-tea/), we’ve got a mobile
      solution to take your brand on the road.


      Last month, we explored the versatility of our custom designed brand bar
      and how it transformed for clients like Maybelline, Vlasic, Yoplait,
      Garnier Fructis and McDonald’s. Check it out here if you missed it.


      Today we’re taking a look at the largest member of EventNetUSA’s fleet,
      our 53” trailer. Not your typical box on wheels, our 53’ event trailer is
      equipped with all the bells and whistles to transform for any brand on the
      road.
