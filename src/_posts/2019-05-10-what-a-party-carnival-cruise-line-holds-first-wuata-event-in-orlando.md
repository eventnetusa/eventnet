      Mixing business and fun, Carnival Cruise Line staged its first WUATA Party
      at The Orlando Science Center in Orlando, Florida on May 8, 2019. Nearly
      300 travel advisors and their clients, who brought along potential
      clients, joined Carnival’s Florida sales team and executives, as well as
      industry leaders, for a gala evening focused around Why Use A Travel
      Advisor.


      The event was hosted by Adolfo Perez, senior vice president, sales and
      trade marketing for Carnival Cruise Line; Mike Julius, vice president,
      field sales for Carnival Cruise Line; John Heald, Carnival Cruise Line
      brand ambassador; and Carnival’s Florida business development manager
      team.


      Ann Chamberlin, senior vice president, membership and strategic
      partnerships for the American Society of Travel Advisors; and Charles
      Sylvia, ECC, vice president, membership and trade relations for Cruise
      Lines International Association; spoke about the importance of travel
      advisor education and training, and the impact it has on vacation quality.


      Perez gave a presentation featuring real-life stories shared by Carnival
      guests about how their travel agents were vacation-planning rock stars.


      Heald, who served as emcee, hosted an informal fireside chat with
      Diamond-level Carnival repeat guest Richard Hunt and his travel advisor,
      Denise McCorkell, of Travel Planners International. During their
      discussion, Hunt shared experiences from his long relationship with
      McCorkell and cited trust as the most important reason to choose and use a
      travel advisor.


      In addition to the cocktail party mix and mingle, there was a WUATA-themed
      photo booth where attendees could take selfies with Perez and Heald.
      Partygoers also participated in WUATA experiences at the event’s WUATA
      Guru Desk, where the Carnival BDM team provided expert one-to-one support
      and opportunities to sign up and share on WUATA Word — which now has
      nearly 4,000 word submissions — and enter the WUATA Contest to name the
      Most Trusted Travel Advisor.


      Fashionable WUATA T-shirts were on sale for $25 with the colorful WUATA
      logo on the front and the WUATA Word cloud on the back, with proceeds
      going to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.


      The WUATA Party featured an array of giveaways throughout the evening,
      including a three-category upgrade and up to $100 in onboard credit for
      everyone who attended. Drawings also were held for a seven-day Carnival
      cruise for one client plus commission for the client’s travel advisor; one
      conference registration for the ASTA National Convention and one
      registration to CruiseWorld; two CLIA memberships; and more, such as logo
      umbrellas, swag bags, etc.


      Due to outstanding response, registration is closed for the remaining
      WUATA Party dates in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto.
