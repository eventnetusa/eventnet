      Carnival Cruise Line will visit travel agents in six cities from May 11-18
      as part of a festival inspired “Agentpalooza” bus tour. Hosted by
      Carnival’s Vice President of Sales & Trade Marketing Adolfo Perez and the
      line’s sales leadership team, the tour encompasses events featuring
      one-on-one meetings between agents and Carnival sales team members,
      marketing and product experiences and a variety of engaging entertainment
      activities. A community service and philanthropic component will round out
      each event.

































































































































      “Visiting agents on a bus tour is an excellent way to cover a great deal of
      ground at once with numerous team members and to do what we do best – work
      with agents on providing the best sales and service we can while having
      a great time along the way,” said Perez. “We have continued the theme from
      our popular ‘Travel Agents Rock’ campaign, and named these festival-style
      events ‘Agentpalooza,’ which we think really captures the celebration of
      our amazing rock star travel partners.”

































































































































      Stops on the “Agentpalooza” bus tour schedule include:

































































































































      * May 11: Houston, Texas

      * May 12: New Orleans, La.

      * May 15: Charleston, S.C.

      * May 16: Atlanta, Ga.

      * May 17: Jacksonville, Fla.

      * May 18: Orlando, Fla.

































































































































      During each event, agents will have the opportunity to engage with Perez
      and the team in four different bus tour areas. A “Carnival Fun Zone”
      features a live DJ, photo booth, lawn games, and a Cherry on Top candy
      area.&nbsp; An “At Your Service” area provides agents the opportunity to
      have one-on-one meetings with the sales leadership team and their local
      business development directors. A “Community Impact” space is dedicated
      towards giving back to local food banks and the Leukemia & Lymphoma
      Society, which Perez is currently supporting as part of its annual
      fundraising drive. Lastly, the line will host a ‘Rockstar Moments’ space in
      Houston and New Orleans where agents can participate in fun video segments,
      to be aired on the line’s trade Facebook and GoCCL.com agent portal.&nbsp;
      Light snacks and exciting raffle prizes, including a complimentary
      eight-day Carnival cruise, will be given away at each “Agentpalooza” tour
      stop.

































































































































      Travel agents are encouraged to sign up early for these events, as
      availability is limited. During the tour dates, agents will also be able to
      follow the tour and participate in events online via GoCCL.com and
      Carnival’s trade Facebook page. For complete details surrounding Carnival’s
