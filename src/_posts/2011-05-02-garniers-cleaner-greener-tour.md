      <div>PRETTY PEOPLE - Gossip Girls Kelly Rutherford and Katie Cassidy joined
      forces with Garnier to launch The Cleaner Greener Tour in NYC. Inspired by
      harsh facts - personal care and beauty products account for one-third of
      all landfill waste-- the cosmetics company recently partnered with
      TerraCycle to launch Garnier Fructis Pure Clean. The biodegradable formulas
      are packaged in 50 percent postconsumer recycled plastics. Now, that's
      something to gossip about!"</div>
