      Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: CELH), makers of the leading global
      fitness drink, CELSIUS&reg;, today announced its signing as Presenting
      Sponsor of the 2018 Tough Mudder North America Challenge event series
      which includes Tough Mudder Half, Tough Mudder Full and the newly launched
      Tough Mudder 5K. &nbsp;This strategic move fulfills a major marketing
      initiative for the brand, whose slogan and targeted demographics' goal is
      to "Live Fit." CELSIUS&reg; is pioneering a new industry segment of
      "fitness drinks," a designation which also describes the brand's
      functional attributes. CELSIUS&reg; drinks are dietary supplements that
      contain a proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus&reg; blend, proven to
      accelerate metabolism, provide healthy energy and burn body fat when
      combined with exercise.&nbsp; These unique, proven qualities make this
      partnership a success, and achieve CELSIUS&reg;' goal of increasing brand
      awareness by tapping into Tough Mudder's extensive fan base and its
      "Tougher Together" brand platform.&nbsp; The sponsorship and 2018 Tough
      Mudder season kicks off this weekend, March 3-4 at East Walker Ranch in
      the Los Angeles area.


      With over 100 events across North America during Tough Mudder weekends,
      and more than three million loyal fitness enthusiasts committed to the
      Tough Mudder lifestyle (also known as "Mudder Nation") CELSIUS&reg; seized
      the Presenting Sponsor spot, anchoring the energy drink position and
      locking out the competition. As a recognized pre-workout drink,
      CELSIUS&reg; will be available before select events to energize
      experienced Mudders and newbies for the demanding obstacles ahead.&nbsp;


      The Presenting Sponsorship secures the CELSIUS&reg; brand with a coveted
      position in a logo lockup across the growing Tough Mudder franchise, an
      iconic and widely recognized series of obstacle course challenges spanning
      the globe. CELSIUS&reg; will mark its presence at Tough Mudder events
      through sampling opportunities, consumer engagements and sponsored
      branding on one of the most legendary teamwork obstacles, Everest, across
      all event formats. Additionally, it will serve as an Official Sponsor of
      the Toughest Mudder and World's Toughest Mudder race series.&nbsp;
      CELSIUS&reg; will have a considerable brand presence on multiple video
      platforms as Tough Mudder has grown into a media and entertainment brand
      with content featured on CBS, The CW, Facebook and YouTube garnering
      millions of viewers throughout the year.


      "When we think about CELSIUS&reg; consumers, we think about individuals
      who want and need a lifestyle brand that is proven to function and
      provides healthy energy - a drink for those who strive to 'Live
      Fit.'&nbsp; Like CELSIUS&reg;, Tough Mudder is a brand that is growing
      exponentially in the fitness channel," said Celsius Holding Inc.'s Chief
      Financial Officer and interim President and CEO, John Fieldly. "Throughout
      this partnership, CELSIUS&reg; will be introduced to the more than three
      million members of Mudder Nation and we're certain that Tough Mudder fans
      will choose to incorporate the brand into their extraordinary lifestyles."


      "CELSIUS&reg; is an excellent fit to be the Presenting Sponsor of the
      Tough Mudder Challenge Series as they too encourage their followers to be
      Tougher Together, live courageously and achieve personal goals, all while
      having fun," said Will Dean, Founder and CEO of Tough Mudder.&nbsp;
      "CELSIUS&reg; exudes the same drive for innovation, level of excellence
      and unstoppable growth, as Tough Mudder. With their ever increasing brand
      visibility, and continued flourishing following, we look forward to a long
      and successful partnership."


      Tough Mudder is a brand built on teamwork, courage, personal
      accomplishment and fun. Last year, CELSIUS&reg; was tested for receptivity
      as a Tough Mudder Local Sponsor in ten cities. It was embraced by
      participants and organizers alike because it speaks to the spirit of Tough
      Mudder, given CELSIUS&reg;' "Live Fit" brand tagline. CELSIUS&reg;
      provided samples pre-event, delivering delicious, and thermogenic energy
      to accelerate participants' performance levels to help endure a series of
      demanding obstacle courses that test strength, grit and stamina.


      "We couldn't think of a better partnership investment between two
      fast-growing and forward-thinking health and fitness brands. We love the
      brand association in the minds of our target demographic. CELSIUS&reg; has
      shown significant growth more recently, particularly with our brand
      repositioning and new line launches last year. We are an award-winning,
      front runner in our category and Tough Mudder is a world-wide winner of a
      brand," said Vanessa Walker, Executive Vice President, Marketing and
      Innovation. "This partnership provides CELSIUS&reg; with a strategic
      marketing initiative both with the experimental on-site aspect and with
      our retailer partners across the fitness, military, e-commerce and
      traditional channels."


      Challenge Series participants will have the choice of sampling original
      and natural sparkling flavors of CELSIUS&reg;: Cucumber Lime, Grapefruit,
      Orange, Grape Rush, Watermelon, Wild Berry, Orange Pomegranate, Cola - and
