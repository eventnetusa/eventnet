      In today’s digitally driven world, e-commerce is dominating, retailers are
      becoming defined by their social media presence, and one-click purchases
      are the expectation. Heritage brands are seeking creative ways to grow with
      consumer lifestyles and new brands are challenged to cut through the
      clutter of the internet.

































































      **With fewer opportunities for consumer-facing interaction, brands must
      create retail store environments that offer the richness of one-on-one
      exchanges along with the convenience of digital solutions.**

































































      It’s no secret that consumers are more likely to purchase products they’ve
      tried. This is the foundation of the booming experiential marketing
      industry. According to the Association of National Advertisers, annual
      brand activation spending was over $560 million in 2015 and is expected to
      reach $740 billion by 2020.

































































      Unfortunately, while in-field activations excel in driving awareness and
      brand loyalty, unless you have a POS system on-site, you’re not making
      direct product sales. Brands need to get their target audience into the
      retail stores for that.

































































      This poses the million-dollar question: **How do brands drive consumer
      loyalty and sales through meaningful in-store experiences in the digital
      era?**

































































      Taking cues from some of the brightest minds in event marketing, brands are
      transforming spaces into experiential havens that seamlessly blend the
      worlds of digital and physical.

































































      The result: **Experiential Retail**. And just like many experiential
      strategies, the goal is to immerse the consumer in the brand and allow the
      sales to follow.

































































      **Take a closer look at NYX Professional Makeup, a digital-native turned
      experiential retail innovator that’s redefining the brick and mortar
      experience.**

































































      NYX Professional Makeup stores set a high bar for experiential retail. The
      cosmetic fangirl’s playground is both a socially entrenched and physically
      interactive experience that adopts the following methods for engaging with
      its media-savvy consumers:

































































      * Beauty Bars double as interactive tutorial stations providing pointers
      and how-to’s for testing NYX products in real-time

      * TV monitors serve up the latest user-generated social content, providing
      shoppers with inspiration and direction.

      * Interactive discovery stations (touch screens built into product
      displays) encourage consumers to scan or search products to yield Instagram
      photos of other NYX consumers wearing the selected product/shade.

      * Further embracing its cult-like Instagram following, NYX holds exclusive
      in-store Meet & Greets with its most popular brand influencers to create an
      immersive social media experience in the retail environment.

































































      NYX Professional Makeup’s answer to this challenge plaguing all retailers
      is genius and brand professionals from any industry can and should take
      note.
