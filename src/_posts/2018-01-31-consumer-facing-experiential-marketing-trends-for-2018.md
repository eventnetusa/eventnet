      It’s no surprise that experiential marketing over traditional marketing is
      on the rise. Consumers want a personal, hands-on experience and
      experiential provides a uniquely fast and effective way to build brand
      awareness through one-on-one connections with consumers.Many industry
      insiders have predicted that experiential marketing will become a tactic
      that marketers cannot avoid in 2018. We’ve gathered some of the top trends
      you will see in 2018.


      **LIVE STREAMING**


      Social Media Integration has long been a mainstay in event activations,
      however, a largely underrated tool that will see a rise in 2018 is the use
      of Live Streaming. EventTrack’s recent study showed that 50% of consumers
      capture and share between two and five photos and videos at branded
      experiences. The study also shows that 72% of consumers are more likely to
      purchase from a brand after watching their friends’ branded experience
      videos.


      Live streaming provides the opportunity for a brand to control their
      content while maintaining authenticity. Consumers engaging in a brand
      independently is the most authentic and low-cost way to reach beyond the
      brand’s immediate audience. It can also be repurposed for other marketing
      campaigns and media placements.


      **RETAIL INTEGRATION – LIVE EXPERIENCES**


      Brands are turning to experiential marketing to entice consumers to shop
      in-store rather than online. These in-store events create unique in-person
      shopping experiences that keep them engaged at every point while shopping.
      Customers will no longer be left to search for items or make purchase
      decisions on their own. Retailers will be using brand advocates and AI to
      guide customers through the shopping experience.


      Many stores, especially beauty brands, are incorporating augmented reality
      for the in-store experience. At Sephora, consumers can see how different
      styles and colors look on their skin without the inconvenience of applying
      the products.&nbsp; Other brands are using apps that can provide users
      with games and prizes when they purchase in store. Brands are taking the
      next step by turning their brick and mortars into pop-up events. These
      events incorporate activations, celebrity appearances and after-hours
      private parties.


      The key to experiential retail integration is allowing consumers to forge
      real-world connections with a brand that isn’t a marketing gimmick. These
      experiences are not to develop new customers but to add meaning and value
      to their brand loyalist.

      **OUT OF VENUE VENUES**


      Traditional venues such as standalone stores, music festivals, and
      landmarks provide consistent traffic and accessibility, versatility, and
      ease of procuring permits. However, as experiential marketing becomes
      increasing popular, brands are finding ways to differentiate their events
      from the rest. One way of standing out is in a unique venue.


      From compact-sized shipping containers to airplanes 3,000 miles high,
      unique venues create an unforgettable experience the moment they enter the
      footprint.


      Nontraditional venue spaces give your attendees something to talk about,
      creates a buzz-worthy backdrop on social media. You can leverage
      innovative venues to project the image of the brand to the attendees
      before they reach the activation.

      **AR, VR AND DRONES**


      AR/VR are great tools to keep your audience engaged, the message
      consistent and the recall value high.


      AR (Augmented Reality) blends digital components into the real world
      allowing users to interact with virtual contents in the real world. Thanks
      to tools like the ARkit, many brands can extend the in-store experience by
      building their own AR apps. This interactive experience allows consumers
      to feel more engaged with a brand leading to an increased likelihood of
      purchase.


      VR (Virtual Reality) is a computer generation that stimulates both vision
      and hearing of user to make them feel as though they are experiencing the
      simulated reality directly. AR pop up exhibits allow consumer to be fully
      immersed in the brand experience and can create unique challenges that
      consumers must complete to move on to another portion of the activation.


      Drones are commonly associated with aerial photography and videography,
      but will increasingly be used as a consumer experience. From synchronized
      light and music shows to fireworks and smoke generators, drones have the
      possibilities to enhance any outdoor event experience.


      With increase interest of AR, VR and Drones, it is important to remember
      that these new technologies are meant to enhance the consumer experience
      not replace the existing marketing strategy
