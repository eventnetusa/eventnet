      kick-off in Orlando, Florida last May. The series is set to continue,
      heading first to New York in September and then to Los Angeles in October.
      The program’s initiative is to help travel professionals attract new
      clients while also providing advisors the opportunity to deepen
      relationships with existing clients through an evening of activations,
      open bar and canap&eacute;s.


      “It’s less about stats and more about value proposition messaging,” said
      Meegan Broussard, Sr. Director for Trade Marketing and Sales
      Communications at Carnival Cruise Line. “Our goal is to share those really
      big value components with people, who may not book with an advisor today,
      but want to know how their next vacation can be the best. It \[value
      components\] can be through getting that message out about how travel
      agents can really make a difference.”


      Prior to the event, TravelPulse Canada had a chance to sit down with
      Adolfo Perez, Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Trade Marketing,
      to find out how the idea for the event series came about.


      “We starting thinking more about how we can add value because this is
      great that we celebrate and have a fun party, but is there something we
      can do to add value,” said Mr. Perez. “I kept thinking back to when I have
      been at a party or some business events where someone asks me what I do
      and they say, ‘travel agents still exist?’. I’m like, ‘Yea they exist\!
      Why wouldn’t you use a travel agent? It’s like having a personal assistant
      pretty much for free.’ Internally we wanted to get this message out… we
      are all busy, working hard, there’s no time to do all this stuff that an
      agent can do for you. On top of that they do so much training… They can
      help you pick the right vacation, whether it’s the right ship, right
      cruise line, right itinerary - they can help you with all that."


      Although messaging throughout the event was geared towards the importance
      of using a travel advisor, agents in attendance seemed to be particularly
      happy to have the event as a chance to entertain existing and potential
      clients, while also using the event as a platform to market Carnival
      Cruise Line.


      “What intrigued me about it when I received the invitation back in April,
      is that I could bring two clients. So the two clients that I brought are
      both cruisers but they have never tried Carnival… my biggest dream is for
      them to get the aspect of it here, learn about the Carnival family, see
      the pros of working with a Travel Agent, which they do already, but why
      they are making a good choice and why Carnival is a good choice for them,”
      shared Coreen Doucett, a travel advisor from The Travel Agent Next Door.


      During the event, agents and their clients will listen to testimonials
      from previous Carnival clients who booked with travel advisors and hear
      from CLIA and ASTA representatives. A draw for a ‘seven-day balcony
      cruise’ will also be up for grabs for a consumer in attendance, plus
      commission for that guest’s travel advisor. In addition to this, consumer
      guests will also receive an exclusive offer from Carnival - a
      ‘three-category stateroom’ upgrade. Travel Advisors will also be able to
      participate in prize draws from CLIA and ASTA.


      Registration is open to all travel advisors and although attending a WUATA
      event is complimentary for travel agents and their clients, there is a
      requirement to pre-register due to venue capacity. Agents can register for
      a Carnival Cruise Line WUATA Party by visiting GoCCL.com.
