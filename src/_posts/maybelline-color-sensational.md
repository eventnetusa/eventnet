      "Maybelline New York-Garnier is well on its way to taking over the beauty
      world, due in no small part to innovative ways of reaching consumers.

















      This year the division of L’Or&eacute;al USA hit the ground
      running—literally—with two cross-country tours that aimed to intimately
      reach consumers. There was The Great Beauty Tour, which joined Maybelline
      New York with Garnier Nutritioniste to educate women on both brands in 22
      markets across the country, 14 of which received print and Internet
      support, while eight markets were reinforced with TV, print and Internet
      support.

















      A custom-made tractor trailer was created for the tour, outfi tted with
      both brands’ advertisements, beauty visuals and rooms large enough to hold
      one-on-one makeup and skin consultations.

















      When the vehicle, which stopped at major events, festivals and retail
      locations across the U.S., was in full setup, the tractor trailer’s
      dimensions were 60 feet long by 35 feet wide.

















      Also during the year was the Garnier Fructis Style Tour, the brand’s first
      national mobile marketing tour, which visited 20 markets executing more
      than 85 events.

















      The tour utilized a style bar, as well as a lounge and sampling, with
      stylist consultations, one-on-one experiences with consumers, product demos
      and entertainment to engage consumers for a complete Garnier Fructis
      experience.

















      Combined with both brands’ high-impact advertising visuals, the message was
      clear: Nothing beats an intimate relationship with the consumer." —A.N
