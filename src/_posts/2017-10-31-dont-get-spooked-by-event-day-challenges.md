      Urban Legend: Every event goes smoothly without any unexpected challenges.


      At EventNetUSA we pride ourselves on our professionalism, ingenuity and
      expert planning to prepare for any hurdles that may come our way.&nbsp;
      Even with the best laid plans some obstacles are out of your control and
      having a security plan or a written plan of action is the best way to
      navigate those bumps smoothly.


      From severe weather and medical emergencies to PR catastrophes, a crisis
      protocol protects the client, the staff and the consumers. We train our
      staff to take action, be flexible and follow standard operating procedures
      with our rule of thumb being to “act as any reasonable persons would under
      the same or similar circumstances”. Every event is armed with on-site
      medical support (defibrillator, stop the bleed kit, etc.) and staff is
      aware of evacuation routes.


      As prepared as we are, we have had our fair share of event day challenges.
      Here are some of the obstacles we’ve faced and how we have overcome them.
