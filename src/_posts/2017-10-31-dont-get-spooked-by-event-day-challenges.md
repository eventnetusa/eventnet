      Urban Legend: Every event goes smoothly without any unexpected challenges.


      At EventNetUSA we pride ourselves on our professionalism, ingenuity and
      expert planning to prepare for any hurdles that may come our way.&nbsp;
      Even with the best laid plans some obstacles are out of your control and
      having a security plan or a written plan of action is the best way to
      navigate those bumps smoothly.


      From severe weather and medical emergencies to PR catastrophes, a crisis
      protocol protects the client, the staff and the consumers. We train our
      staff to take action, be flexible and follow standard operating procedures
      with our rule of thumb being to “act as any reasonable persons would under
      the same or similar circumstances”. Every event is armed with on-site
      medical support (defibrillator, stop the bleed kit, etc.) and staff is
      aware of evacuation routes.


      As prepared as we are, we have had our fair share of event day challenges.
      Here are some of the obstacles we’ve faced and how we have overcome them.

      ### **<u>WEATHER</u>**


      **FPL - Beat The Heat Cooling Station**


      * **The Activation** - We partnered with FPL and rbb Communications to
      construct an ice cube cooling station that helped guest “chill” out
      through a fun, interactive experience at 4 major outdoor family locations
      in South Florida.

      * **The Challenge** - &nbsp;Hurricane Irma came sweeping through South
      Florida before the second event and FPL needed to divert their time and
      resources to restoring power and helping their consumers.

      * **The Solution** - Collectively we decide to postpone the events until
      the following year.

      * **The Outcome** – Being flexible with the client allowed us to maintain
      a positive working relationship creating the opportunity for more events.

      **Carnival’s Agentpalooza 2017 – New Orleans**


      * **The Activation** - EventNetUSA partnered with Carnival Cruise Line to
      produce and operate the&nbsp; Agentpalooza 2017 Campaign tour in 6
      markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      * **The Challenge** – The New Orleans event was hit with a severe
      thunderstorm tearing down tents and flooding the venue.

      * **The Solution** – EventNetUSA quickly rescheduled the event to take
      place the following day, including venue coordination, rerouting and
      travel logistics, rescheduled vendors, notifyed attendees etc.

      * **The Outcome** – The rescheduled event went off without a hitch and
      created a memorable experiences for the client and guests.

      ### <u><strong>SECURITY</strong></u>


      **Michelle Obama's "Drink Up" Campaign Launch**


      * **The Activation**– We partnered with Y&R and Healthier America to
      design and produce former First Lady Michelle Obama’s national Drink Up
      Campaign launch.

      * **The Challenge** – Due to high level security, EventNet had to be
      thoroughly vetted by the Secret Service including permits and security
      procedures. Furthermore, we were only given details of the venue and
      location 3 weeks prior to the event making routing and logistics
      challenging.

      * **The Solution** – We created a very detailed plan of action that every
      department of the event stuck to. Venue operators sent photos and
      dimensions allowing us to create a floor plan without knowing the details
      of the venue.

      * **The Outcome** – With everyone sticking to the written plan of action,
      the event was executed seamlessly.

      ### <u><strong>PR CRISIS</strong></u>


      Dress To Di For Tour


      * **The Activation** – Our SVP, at a previous company, was involved with
      the famous Dress to Di for Tour featuring one of Princess Diana’s gala
      gowns at malls in multiple markets.

      * **The Challenge** – Princess Diana tragically passed away the night
      before one of the events. The event was going to feature media coverage.

      * **The Solution** – The team went into the venue overnight and dismantled
      the entire activation not leaving a trace behind. They canceled all
      remaining events as well as took down any marketing/promotion materials.

      * **The Outcome**– They were able to provide respect to the royal family
      as well as avoid a PR crisis for the client.
