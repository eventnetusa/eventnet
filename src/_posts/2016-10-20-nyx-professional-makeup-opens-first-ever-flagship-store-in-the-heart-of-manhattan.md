      <div><p>LOS ANGELES, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- NYX Professional Makeup
      is set to launch its first flagship store in Manhattan on Friday, October
      28th, just in time for Halloween. Located in the heart of Union Square,
      the cosmetic company's 20th domestic store is perfectly positioned for New
      Yorkers and tourists alike to shop the complete line of affordable,
      professional makeup.</p><p>NYX Professional Makeup stores combine digital
      technology with a hands-on educational environment that provides consumers
      with a completely new makeup experience. In keeping with its heritage as a
      truly digital brand, NYX Professional Makeup stores feature a series of
      innovative technologies, such as the exclusive in-store Beauty Bar, an
      interactive makeup station featuring custom video tutorials, a trend-based
      Lip Bar, and Shadow Bar.</p><p>"It is very important to us that our
      digitally-enhanced stores marry the online beauty community with the
      everyday retail world," said Nathalie Kristo, General Manager, Marketing
      and Global Business Development. "The NYX Professional Makeup store is a
      place where we celebrate our online community while encouraging every day
      customers to come play, and experiment, and have fun with makeup. We have
      created interactive features for consumers to enjoy while educating
      themselves in the process."</p><p>Exclusive to the Union Square flagship
      store will be several new features, including:</p><p>The Colorcast wall:
      Colorcast showcases the colors of the NYX Professional Makeup community
      from across the world. Colorcast will scan your colors and reflect back
      the makeup artistry that features those shades. Shoppers will also be able
      to filter the community content based on hair color, eye color, or iconic
      NYX Professional Makeup products.</p><p>Education: Three new digital
      makeup education experiences that will turn any makeup novice into an
      expert: the Brush Bar where anyone can master the techniques and uses of
      each brush, the Lash Bar where a guided experience can help shoppers find
      the perfect false lashes, and the Masterclass area where influencers and
      experts teach classes on makeup artistry.</p><p>Services: Shoppers at the
      Union Square store will be able to sign up for personalized one-on-one
      lessons from the NYX Professional Makeup artists. The menu of lessons
      includes highlight &amp; contour, lash application, brow mastery, and
      others.</p><p>"After a year of successful openings across the country, we
      are thrilled to open our first flagship store in New York City, right in
      the heart of Manhattan," said Scott Friedman, President of NYX
      Professional Makeup. "New York is the ultimate beauty mecca with a very
      discerning customer, which means the store has to feel special and unique.
      Through exclusive, interactive areas within our largest footprint yet,
      customers will be treated to a customized beauty shopping experience
      unlike any other."</p><p>The NYX Professional Makeup Union Square Grand
      Opening will take place on Friday, October 28th (9am&ndash;11pm),
