      On Tuesday, March 5th, leading health and well-being company Humana opened
      a new community location in Norridge, inside Harlem Irving Plaza (“the
      HIP”).&nbsp; Situated at the center of the mall, near parking garage
      entrances “C” and “H,” the location is open every Tuesday.


      Activities include


      * Cooking demonstrations

      * Exercise classes

      * Educational seminars

      * Social activities like crafts and bingo


      Humana membership is not required for most activities.&nbsp; It’s a place
      to make friends, have fun, and engage in healthy activities – and in
      addition, anyone with a Humana health plan can get help with customer
      service questions.


      The new location is part of Humana’s commitment to improving the health
      and well-being of the communities it serves.&nbsp; Humana has opened
      community locations in 18 states as a way to break down barriers to health
      and help community members live healthier lives.&nbsp;


      Humana’s Norridge community location is open every Tuesday from 9a.m. to
      3p.m.&nbsp; For more information, call 331-315-5219.
