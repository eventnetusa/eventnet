      2010 – 2019 Revealed an exciting new trend across the marketing industry.
      Brands began moving away from traditional marketing, looking for
      innovative ways to create memorable, one-on-one experiences with consumers
      through experiential activations.


      As we reflect, our team has had the pleasure of working with incredible
      brands and agencies to create unforgettable experiences and bring their
      big ideas to life. &nbsp;Thank you to ALL our amazing clients for making

      sampling at one of the year’s largest events. By infiltrating South
      Florida with street teams, branded Vespas and Mini Coopers, LaCroix stole
      the show as the unofficial sponsor of Superbowl XLIV.
