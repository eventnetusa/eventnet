      FPL is hosting Cooling Stations to help you beat the heat and lower your
      bill. Located at popular destinations across south Florida, the Cooling
      Stations help guests “chill” out through a fun, interactive experience
      that includes a video souvenir.


      Guests will learn how to use FPL’s energy-saving tips and tools – like its
      mobile app and Online Home Energy Survey – to help them become energy
      experts, and take control of their usage and bill.
