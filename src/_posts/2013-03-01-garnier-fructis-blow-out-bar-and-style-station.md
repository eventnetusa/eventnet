      #### From [The Glamazon
      Diaries](http://glamazondiaries.com/2013/02/new-york-fashion-week-lounge-garnier-fructis-blow-out-bar-style-station.html):









      "One of the best things about New York Fashion Week is finding refuge from
      the tents at one of the lavish lounges in and around Lincoln Center.&nbsp;
      Garnier Fructis wants you to look your very best this fashion week by
      opening a Blow Out Bar & Style Station at the Time Warner Center.&nbsp;
      Celebrity hairstylist Tommy Buckett and his team will be on hand to give
      you a photo-ready blowout, braids, and even lavish curls, mermaid waves
      anyone?&nbsp; You can also score some goodies, prizes and giveaways while
      there, including Garnier Fructis products.









      The Garnier Fructis Blow Out Bar & Style Station is open to the public but
      make sure to stop inside to book an appointment.&nbsp; It’s open for just
      two days and we’re sure Saturday is going to be a busy day since there are
      so many parties happening right after the shows end."
