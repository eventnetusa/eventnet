      <div>Watertown -- First lady Michelle Obama has been trying to get American
      kids to become more physically active through her &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
      Move!&rdquo; initiative.<p>Now, she is urging everyone to &ldquo;Drink
      Up.&rdquo;</p><p>To drive home the message, Obama came to Watertown High
      School on Thursday to pitch Americans on the health benefits of drinking
      water.</p><p>And for those who might dismiss such a campaign, Obama had
      a ready answer.</p><p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of people
      out there who might be asking &mdash; water? Really, water? What&rsquo;s
      the big deal?&rdquo; Obama said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not new. It
      doesn&rsquo;t come in different colors or shapes. In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t
      even have a color or a shape. And to be honest with you, not long ago,
      I might have been thinking the same thing.&rdquo;</p><p>Obama said she has
      come &ldquo;to realize that if we were going to take just one step to make
      ourselves and our families healthier, probably the single best thing we
      could do is to simply drink more water. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Drink
      more water.&rdquo;</p><p>Obama&rsquo;s appearance launched the roll-out of
      the nationwide &ldquo;Drink Up&rdquo; campaign.</p><p>The effort brings
      together the first lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Move!&rdquo; program
      with the Partnership for a Healthier America and is backed by government,
      media, industry, nonprofit groups and municipalities.</p><p>The Drink Up
      drop-of-water logo will appear on nearly 300 million packs of bottled water
      and more than a half billion bottles of water as well as public drinking
      stations around the country.</p><p>Watertown Mayor John David told the
      audience, &ldquo;Needless to say, I&rsquo;m excited.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It
      is a great honor for our city,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Wis-Pak Inc. and 7 UP
      Bottling Co., local employers, both bottle and distribute water, David
      said.</p><p>Lawrence Soler, president and CEO of the Partnership for
      a Healthier America,&rdquo; said drinking more water is one of the easiest
      and healthiest things people can do every day.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not
      asking you to stop drinking anything. We&rsquo;re just asking you to drink
      more water,&rdquo; Soler said.</p><p>Mitch Port, Watertown High
      School&rsquo;s student body president, introduced the first lady. He said
      he was surprised to hear &ldquo;she was coming to our
      school.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I never imagined she&rsquo;d be here,&rdquo; he
      said.</p><p>After her first speech, Obama, accompanied by actress Eva
      Longoria, addressed around 1,500 students gathered in the school&rsquo;s
      gymnasium.</p><p>She urged the students to remain active and said, &ldquo;I
      see a lot of jocks. This looks like a school that keeps moving all the
      time.&rdquo;</p><p>Obama and the students raised their water bottles and
      she said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give a toast to the best drink in
      town.&rdquo;</p><p>Students appeared to heed the first lady&rsquo;s message
      as they participated in several water-related games set up throughout the
      gymnasium.</p><p>Perched in the bleachers was a handmade sign that read:
      &ldquo;Welcome Mrs. Obama.&rdquo;</p><p>Tyler Jones, 16, a sophomore nose
      tackle on the football team, said drinking water is
      important.</p><p>&ldquo;As a football player, I have to stay
      hydrated,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not hydrated during
      a game, you&rsquo;re gassed out.&rdquo;</p><p>He said the coaches talked up
      the Obama visit during practice this week.</p><p>Gretchen Guse, 16,
      a junior, said the &ldquo;Drink Up&rdquo; initiative was a &ldquo;good
      idea,&rdquo; and she was thrilled to see the first lady.</p><p>&ldquo;I
      appreciate that she came here to talk to us,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Drinking more water is a good
      choice everyone can make every day,&rdquo; said Kelli Stader, nutrition
      coordinator with the Chronic Disease Prevention Unit of the Wisconsin
      Division of Public Health.</p><p>&ldquo;Water can give you more energy so
      you can do more, longer, with better focus,&rdquo; Stader said. &ldquo;With
      nearly 25% of children not drinking water on any given day, this is an
      important message for Wisconsin children.&rdquo;</p><p>Some, however, have
      questioned the value of the campaign.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very
      &lsquo;safe&rsquo; message. There&rsquo;s no harm that can come from
      it,&rdquo; said SuJean Choi, an associate professor of biomedical sciences
      at Marquette University.</p><p>&ldquo;Despite that I like Michelle Obama,
      I&rsquo;m pretty skeptical about how much a campaign for drinking more
      water would accomplish,&rdquo; Choi said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
      it&rsquo;ll lead to a dramatic improvement in health.&rdquo;</p><p>The
      drink-more-water message &ldquo;is definitely how to keep everybody happy
      because no one is saying to replace something else with water,&rdquo; Choi
      said. &ldquo;Could they also add, but don&rsquo;t take that extra water
      from a plastic bottle? The impact of a campaign decreasing the number of
      water bottles thrown away in landfills might be greater than encouraging
      individuals to drink one more glass of water.&rdquo;</p><h4>This activation
