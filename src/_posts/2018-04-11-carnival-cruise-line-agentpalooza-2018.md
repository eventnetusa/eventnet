      Carnival Cruise Line will visit agents on its popular festival- inspired
      “Agentpalooza” bus tour from June 11-14 with stops throughout Southern
      California. &nbsp;Hosted by Carnival’s Senior Vice President of Sales &
      Trade Marketing Adolfo Perez and the line’s sales leadership team, each
      tour stop includes five different areas featuring specific entertainment
      and sales and marketing activities. A main stage will feature new
      marketing and product experiences and a variety of engaging entertainment
      activities between agents and Carnival sales team members.


      “Last year’s event was such a great success thanks to the support, active
      participation and enthusiasm of the thousands of travel agent partners who
      showed us exactly why we call them rock stars,” said Perez. “We’re excited
      to take the bus tour to Southern California and visit with agents as we
      build excitement for the arrival of our newest ship, Carnival Panorama,
      which arrives in Long Beach at the end of 2019.”


      New this year with the Agentpalooza tour is a T-shirt design contest that
      launches today. Agents may submit a rock&roll-inspired design to the line
      through April 25, 2018. A Carnival judging panel comprised of Perez,
      Carnival Cruise Line’s President Christine Duffy and Carnival Cruise
      Line’s Vice President of North American Sales Mike Julius will select a
      final design to be featured on the official 2018 Agentpalooza T-shirt. The
      winner will receive a seven-day Carnival Caribbean cruise and five runners
      up will receive $100 gift cards. The T-shirts will be sold at each event,
      with all profits going to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.


      Stops on the “Agentpalooza” bus tour schedule include:


      * June 11: Pasadena, Calif. – Rose Bowl Stadium

      * June 12: Orange County, Calif. – Mile Square Park

      * June 13: San Diego, Calif.- Chula Vista Bayside Park

      * June 14: Long Beach, Calif.- Carnival’s Long Beach Cruise Terminal


      Each event will feature a red carpet entrance where agents may take
      “selfies” using a custom “Travel Agents Rock” filter. Agents will also
      have an opportunity to sign their name on the Agentpalooza bus and apply
      temporary “Travel Agents Rock” tattoos resembling the tattoo Perez had
      inked on his arm at last year’s event.


      As a new element, agents may participate in games designed to bring
      Carnival’s onboard experience to life, all of which will be hosted by a
      Carnival cruise director. These include a “Choose Fun” trivia game, bingo
      and dancing. &nbsp;Throughout the event, agents will meet and interact
      with the sales leadership team and their local business development
      directors. &nbsp;A merchandise tent will have Carnival items for sale with
      all profits benefiting St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Light snacks
      will be provided and exciting prizes, including a complimentary Carnival
      cruise for two, will be given away at each “Agentpalooza” tour stop.


      Registration is now open. Travel agents are encouraged to sign up early
      for these events, as availability is limited. During the tour dates,
      agents will also be able to follow the tour and participate in events
      online via GoCCL.com and Carnival’s trade Facebook page. For complete
      details surrounding Carnival’s “Agentpalooza” bus tour, travel agents may
