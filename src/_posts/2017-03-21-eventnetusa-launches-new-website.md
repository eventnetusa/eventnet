      Kicking off Spring with something fresh, EventNetUSA’s newly redesigned
      website goes live today. The Fort Lauderdale-based experiential marketing
      agency announces [www.eventnetusa.com](http://www.eventnetusa.com)'s new
      look is in full bloom.





      Founded in 1976, EventNetUSA produces and manages marketing activations
      nationwide for some of the world’s most recognizable brands and agencies,
      including Coca Cola, L’Oreal, Aetna Inc., Young & Rubicam, and even the
      White House.





      Set with the goal of bringing brand ideas to life with originality and
      quality, the event marketing company prides themselves in their expertise
      in delivering turnkey solutions on time and on budget for brands and their
      agencies across the U.S.





      Today, EventNetUSA takes their commitment to making their client’s brand
      activations simple and stress-free one step further.





      The new website, designed with the user experience in mind, will help
      marketing managers and account executives identify the agency’s
      capabilities and portfolio more quickly and clearly than ever before.





      Access to in-depth case studies provide insight to their breadth of
      experience as well as the level of data collection that distinguishes this
      boutique agency’s delivery from the rest. With a portfolio spanning from
      the beauty industry to health insurance to beverages and more, you'd be
      pressed to find a logistics company with a more diverse history.





      Another noteworthy addition is a new Careers page. With at least 1 program
      on the road any given day of the year, EventNetUSA is constantly placing
      staff to deliver their clients’ brand messaging. This added technology
      welcomes top talent and allows to more seamlessly identify the perfect
      brand ambassador or account manager for each activation.





      EventNetUSA’s website will be updated on a regular basis with news of
      current programs, case studies on the latest activations, company
      milestones, industry whitepapers, and job listings for those looking to
      join their team.





      Visitors are invited to explore the website and encouraged to subscribe to
      the monthly newsletter to stay up to date with company happenings.
