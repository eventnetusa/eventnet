excerpt: "New York City's latest attraction, the FINE LIVING Island, created by  Scripps Networks' newest network and website, embodies the FINE LIVING brand  philosophy: \"Live like you mean it.\"  With a heated hut and plenty of  amenities on their own 5,400 square-foot private island, Rob and Emily Hache  and their dog Dudley clearly have no intention of roughing it as \"survivors.\""
