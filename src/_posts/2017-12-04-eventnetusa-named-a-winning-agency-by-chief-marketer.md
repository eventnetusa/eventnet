      **From Chief Marketer [Top 200
      Overview](http://www.chiefmarketer.com/cm200/):**&nbsp;Chief Marketer, a
      leading publisher of content, recognition programs and training events for
      Fortune 1000 marketers, today unveiled the Chief Marketer 200. It is the
      world’s first and only comprehensive editorial list of the best
      non-advertising agencies. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The CM200 features editorial
      listings and coverage of agencies spanning 11 categories, including
      Experiential, Sports & Entertainment, Promotion, Retail/Shopper,
      Digital/Content, Social Media, Design and Innovation, B2B Demand Gen, B2B
      Brand Engagement Marketing, B2B Experiential Marketing and Martech.
      Editorial profiles include details on core capabilities and
      specializations, examples of outstanding work, insights on culture and
      people, client examples and RFP contact information.
      &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>“The marketing landscape has changed dramatically in
      the past decade. Advertising is no longer driving the rest of the
      marketing mix,” says Jessica Heasley, Content Director at Chief Marketer.
      “Nonadvertising spending is on the rise because it speaks to the wants and
      needs of today’s customers. The Chief Marketer 200 helps marketing
      professionals navigate this vibrant and fast-moving community of agencies
      and gives them insights to seek out the right partners for their
      brands.”&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Chief Marketer’s editors accepted submissions
      from across the country for the CM200 earlier this fall. Winners were
      selected based on several criteria including: insightful client
      testimonials; outstanding case study submissions; high caliber, consistent
      work across programs and clients; innovative and creative executions; and
      bold and inspiring concepts and ideas that are moving the industry
      forward. The 200 agencies selected for this year’s inaugural program are
      thought leaders in their craft and representative of the best of the
      marketing industry. The CM200 is sponsored by Sysomos."&nbsp;


      **From the EventNetUSA CM200 Summary:** "Don’t let its status as one of
      the oldest experiential marketing agencies in the industry fool you—this
      shop is 41 years young. From its sunny offices in Fort Lauderdale,
      EventNetUSA churns out a mind-boggling schedule of mobile tours, pop-up
      stores, grand openings and events for a wide variety of clients ranging
      from healthcare giants like Humana, Aetna and Blue Cross Blue Shield to
      beauty leaders including Revlon, Maybelline, Garnier Fructis and Essie.
      Added this year Carnival Cruise Line to expand its reach in travel and
      hospitality and launched a Beauty + Swag truck for NYX makeup, with
      express lip touch-ups and social media amplification prompts. A fleet of
      in-house mobile marketing vehicles means shorter lead times and lower
      costs for clients. A new 250+ venue marketing network called SARC will
      offer baby boomer marketers unprecedented insights and data."
