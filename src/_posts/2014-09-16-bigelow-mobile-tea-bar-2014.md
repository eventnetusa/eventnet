      <div><p>"FAIRFIELD -- When Bigelow Tea's leadership decided to spread their
      passion for tea across the nation, they knew not just any form of
      transportation would do.</p><p>'We did a lot of work trying to find the
      perfect vehicle,' said Tim Richmond, the company's marketing project
      manager.</p><p>The Fairfield-based business found that vehicle in a 1977
      Air Stream travel trailer it converted into its first-ever Mobile Tea Bar,
      unveiled Tuesday.</p><p>Featuring 40 different tea flavors and several bar
      stools, the inside of the trailer was converted into a mini bar, with
      images of the Bigelow family and the tea company's history lining the
      walls. Intimate, professional, but fun is how Cindi Bigelow, president of
      Bigelow Tea, describes the 31-foot trailer.</p><p>'The team did an amazing
      job of creating a vehicle that has the spirit of who we are,' she said.
      'This is our way to share with people that we're a family company. We're an
      American family that is passionate about tea.'</p><p>The Mobile Tea Bar's
      first stop will be Sunday in Boston. Then it will continue to New York and
      New Jersey before traveling to street fairs and festivals in large cities
      across the nation.</p><p>The tour marks the start of the company's 70th
      anniversary celebration.</p><p>At each location, customers will also be
      able to take a photo with 'Biggie,' Bigelow Tea's walking mug mascot, and
      share it with the company through Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>'Consumers
      are becoming more and more educated about tea and seeking a deeper level of
      interaction than ever before,' said Richmond. 'We realized in celebrating
      our 70th anniversary we really wanted to get out there and spread the tea
      experience with our consumers.'</p><p>First Selectman Michael Tetreau said
      he recently visited the Sarasota, Florida, airport and a bed and breakfast
      in Maine, where Bigelow tea was served.</p><p>'I'm amazed at how much
      innovation goes through every aspect of your business,' he said, addressing
      the Bigelow family. 'I don't think there's even a software development
      company that is more innovative than what you are and what you're doing
      here. How about that?'</p><p>Eunice Bigelow, co-chairman of the company
      along with her husband David Bigelow Jr., said their daughter has done
      a great job using social media to move the company forward and place the
      brand in the public eye.</p><p>'We don't do a lot of advertising so this is
      going to be great advertisement for us,' Eunice Bigelow, whose in laws
      started Bigelow tea, said. 'When you go across the country and see a big
      mobile tea bar you're going to pay attention.'</p><p>Cindi Bigelow said
      people often forget that the company is family-run and smaller than some of
      its competitors. 'We don't have all the money the big boys have but this is
      a big investment for us,' she said.</p></div>
